## Declaration:
I find this course assignments are little difficult for a begineer who want enter in *Data Science* field, this may leads to give up on the data science so i will give this answwers for those who found difficult in the course assignment.

## My Points

Getting certified is not the important part in any course but that also one of the part to showcase our skills to those who hire us. So imporve your knowledge as well.
